# Backlog

Informal list of improvements not yet scheduled into a plan doc.

## Background/tray process to keep stock sync alive

**Problem:** Platform stock sync currently only runs while the StockSmith app is open, so stock levels can drift out of sync while the app is closed.

**Ask:** Explore a system-tray background process that can start on PC boot and keep running when the main StockSmith window is closed, so platform stock sync stays alive continuously.

## eBay listing index — use the real listing id as external_listing_id

**Problem:** `EbayAdapter._index_inventory_item` sets `external_listing_id=sku`, which isn't a listing id. The real one is now fetched during offer enrichment (`_enrich_with_offers`) but deliberately not written, because for eBay that field holding the SKU is a documented invariant with a second writer: `listing_adoption.apply_adoption` mirrors it, and `docs/listing-adoption.md` states it as a safety property.

Functionally nothing reads it except null checks, and the frontend types but never renders it. One behaviour would improve: `listing_push._get_listing_lock` would key on the real listing id, so variants of one multi-variation listing serialise instead of racing.

**Ask:** Switch `external_listing_id` to the real eBay listing id, updating `listing_adoption.apply_adoption`, `docs/listing-adoption.md` and the ~8 test assertions that encode the current invariant in lockstep. Worth doing as its own commit so it stays revertible.

## Variant BOM — audit existing substitutions onto un-ruled base lines

**Problem:** Found while planning the variant conflict-detection work. If a variant substitutes base line A onto material M, and M is *itself* a base BOM line that nothing substitutes away, no unique-constraint violation occurs (there's no override row for M to collide with) — but `_RESOLVED_VARIANT_BOM_SQL` (`backend/app/services/buildability.py:75-98`) then emits M twice via `UNION ALL`, and `compute_variant_buildability` takes `min()` of per-line bottlenecks against the same `current_qty` rather than summing consumption (`:232-238`). With `current_qty=10` and both lines at qty 1, it reports 10 buildable when the true answer is 5. (`cost_per_unit` sums, so cost is unaffected.)

Phase 4 of the backlog-burndown plan rejects this configuration at generation time going forward, but says nothing about rows already in the database.

**Ask:** Audit existing `product_variant_materials` for substitutions targeting an un-ruled base BOM line, and decide whether `_RESOLVED_VARIANT_BOM_SQL` should sum duplicate materials rather than emit them twice — which would fix any such rows already stored, rather than only preventing new ones.

## Variant BOM — provenance column for overrides

**Problem:** `ProductVariantMaterial` has no column distinguishing a rule-generated override from a hand-edited one. The bulk-amend feature therefore can't preserve manual edits automatically — it has to show a preview and make the human consent to each overwrite.

**Ask:** Add a `source` column (`"rule" | "manual"`) so bulk operations can leave hand-edited rows alone by default.
